# Final-Project

Final Project template: 8.1
Secure IoT Device Management in a Safety-Critical Smart Environment

Module: CM3040 – Physical Computing and the Internet of Things

⸻

Project

Develop a framework and technological solution to monitor, manage, and control IoT devices in a trusted network, suitable for safety-critical systems such as:
	•	Smart grids
	•	Smart motorways
	•	Healthcare infrastructure
	•	Industrial manufacturing systems

⸻

Background & Context

As IoT ecosystems grow, managing them securely becomes increasingly complex due to:
	•	Heterogeneous device types
	•	Varied communication protocols
	•	Conflicting commercial and open-source platforms
	•	Limited third-party integration options

	•	Review and critically analyse state-of-the-art research
	•	Develop a custom security framework for IoT device onboarding and control
	•	Build a dashboard for visualising IoT device status and behaviour
	•	Implement policy-based automation (e.g. alert, block, isolate device)
	•	Deploy a proof-of-concept prototype, either virtual or physical
	•	Include real devices or reliable simulation
	•	Demonstrate remote device management functionality
	•	Evaluate and reflect on the effectiveness of the framework
	•	Prepare clear documentation and testing walkthroughs

Submit a draft of some aspects of your project report. 
The report must consist of four chapters, and have a total maximum word limit of 6000 words 
(excluding title page, reference list, etc). 

The chapters required are:
	•	An introduction: this explains the project concept and motivation for the project (this can be based on your proposal). This must also state which project template you are using (max 1000 words).
 	•	A literature review: this is a revised version of the document that you submitted for your second peer review (max 2500 words).
  	•	A design: this is a revised version of the document that you submitted for your third peer review (max 2000 words).
   	•	A feature prototype: this is the only new element of the submission, details below (max 1500 words).

The per-chapter maximums are strict, as is the overall word count. Note that the total of the four chapter word counts is 7000 --- this is not an error but it allows you flexibility in the lengths of each chapter, and lets you balance the document to some extent.
