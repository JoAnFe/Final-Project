# Final-Project

Final Project template: 8.1
Secure IoT Device Management in a Safety-Critical Smart Environment

Module: CM3040 – Physical Computing and the Internet of Things

⸻

Project

Develop a framework and technological solution to monitor, manage, and control IoT devices in a trusted network, suitable for safety-critical systems such as:
	•	Smart grids
	•	Smart motorways
	•	Healthcare infrastructure
	•	Industrial manufacturing systems
